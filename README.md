This is the open source code repository of the website GALOULI https://galouli.com/, an open source Algerian citizen participation platform.
It is a fork of the [Consul Project](https://github.com/consul/consul) with some Front End changes in order to improve the User Interface especially on mobile using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)

> ##### Privacy and data protection (To be done)
Currently the project do not provide any protection and all data such as emails can be collected by admin users.
The goal is develop a system to encrypt all users data and move the infrastructure to a privacy and censorship resistant provider.  
We currently recommend the user who wish to protect their privacy to use VPN and single use emails
