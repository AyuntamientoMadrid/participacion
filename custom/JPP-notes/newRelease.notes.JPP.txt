- [ ] Make sure that the right version of Ruby is in use: rvm only checks the version when changing directory. Therefore, do:
cd ..
cd consuldemocracy
rvm install "ruby-x.x.x"

- [ ] Should a new version of Ruby be required, a message should be displayed on stdout.

- [ ] if the Ruby version has changed, capistrano should likely be updated too:
gem install capistrano
bundle install
