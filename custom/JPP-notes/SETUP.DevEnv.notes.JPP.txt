# Installation notes for a local dev environment, to be deployed with capistrano

## Preliminary comments

- Prerequisites
MUST CHECK THE UBUNTU PREREQUISITES! Should prevent some of the issues below...
```
https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/tech_docs/introduction-1/local_installation/ubuntu
```

- The procedure: 
```
https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/tech_docs/introduction-1/local_installation
```

- IMPORTANT: should prefer rbenv to other ruby version managers, in order to be able to use the right version through `.ruby-version`, but the guidelines, so far, have only been tested with rvm (bottom-line: keep rvm until the shift to rbenv is supported)

- Check the multiple related [Q/A](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/discussions/categories/q-a) and issues on github

## step by step
### Step #1: OK

### Step #2: Install the Ruby version manager:
Installing rbenv with apt seems not to be enough: the version expected by
consudemocracy can not be found. Hence the following actions:

- [ ] install homebrew -- OBSOLETE DO *NOT* USE BREW (CONFLICTS WITH APT)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

- [ ] update the PATH var with brew -- OBSOLETE DO *NOT* USE BREW (CONFLICTS WITH APT)
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/prost/.bashrc
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    
- [ ] Install Homebrew's dependencies:  -- OBSOLETE DO *NOT* USE BREW (CONFLICTS WITH APT)
sudo apt-get install build-essential

- [ ] install recommanded GCC: OBSOLETE: USE APT
brew install gcc

- [ ] install rbenv (the actual ruby version manager): OBSOLETE: USE APT
brew install rbenv
brew upgrade rbenv

- [ ] add rbenv to the PATH:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

### Steps #3-4: OK

### Step #5: install the required gems using Bundler:

* ERROR case: missing PostgreSQL client library
 * Fix: install libpq or postgresql client package like so:
```
sudo apt install libpq-dev
```

 * then run again:
```
bundle
```

* ERROR case: CMake required
 * Fix:
```
sudo apt install cmake
```

also installed, but not sure it's required:
```
sudo apt install ruby-rugged
```

* ERROR case: not sure why...
Seems to be a problem related to libgit2 and OpenSSL.
lib-git2-28 was already installed. Installed lib-git2-deb, but still fails.

* In case some libraries were installed with homebrew on Ubuntu:
```
brew uninstall rbenv
remove rbenv from the PATH in .bashrc
```
Then install rvm : 
```
https://rvm.io/rvm/install and https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm
```

## CLONE CUSTOM FORK TO DIFFERENT LOCAL DESTINATION FOR FRESH INSTALL (with
clean DB)

- [ ] clone your fork

- [ ] Prerequisite: make sure that the correct version of ruby is used (rvm
checks the version every time the current dir changes):
cd..;cd consuldemocracy

It should be enough to copy and update the following:
- [ ] config/database.yml
- [ ] config/secrets.yml
- [ ] config/deploy-secrets.yml

- [ ] Push the changes, if any:
git add .
git commit -a -m "Add sample text to homepage"
git push origin stable

- [ ] deploy:
./deploy-capistrano.sh
